# **Data and Workflow Repository for Nasa RR-5 Space Mice Study ~ Bedree et al.**
***Implicated Connections Between The Gut Microbiome and Bone Homeostasis within Spaceflight***

This is the repository for data and supplemental materials referenced in the paper.
Raw Data for both WGS and 16S analysis for this study is available on the NASA Gene Lab Data Respository - Link

## WGS Data
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) was performed on 20 Samples with an average Read Depth of 70,674,403 reads/sample
Reads were processed using the midas_nextflow workflow - Link

Output consists of:
 - Species Analysis - 
 - Gene Analysis -

## 16S Data
16S rRNA sequencing was performed on 20 samples amplifying the V1-V3 region with an average Read Depth of X reads/sample
Reads were processed using custom bioinformatic workflows in R

Output consitis of:
 - Taxonomic Analysis
